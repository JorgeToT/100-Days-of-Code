# Day 6 of Code Challenge

For the day 6, I used the following [page](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json) to create an algorithm with functions and make that the robot always found the exit from the maze.
